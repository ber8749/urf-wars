# Commit Message Guidelines

This project follows the [Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

## Commit Message Format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope**, and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer than 100 characters.

## Type

Must be one of the following:

- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: vite, npm)
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

## Scope

The scope should be the name of the module/system affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog). Examples for this project:

- **core**: Core game engine (Entity, Component, System, World, Game)
- **physics**: Physics system and Rapier integration
- **rendering**: Three.js rendering, shaders, post-processing
- **audio**: Sound system and synthesizers
- **input**: Input handling and controls
- **weapons**: Weapon systems and projectiles
- **mech**: Mech-specific logic and animations
- **hud**: HUD and UI components
- **config**: Configuration files
- **network**: Networking and multiplayer

## Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Don't capitalize the first letter
- No dot (.) at the end

## Body

Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

## Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines.

## Examples

```
docs(readme): update installation instructions
```

```
feat(weapons): add heat-seeking missile launcher

Implements a new weapon type that tracks enemy mechs using their heat signature.
The tracking algorithm uses predictive targeting based on target velocity.

Closes #42
```

```
fix(physics): correct collision detection for projectiles

The previous implementation was using bounding box checks which caused
projectiles to pass through thin obstacles.

BREAKING CHANGE: Projectile collider shapes have changed from boxes to capsules.
```

```
refactor(core): extract event bus into separate module
```

```
perf(rendering): optimize shadow map updates

Only update shadow maps when light sources or shadow-casting objects move.
This reduces GPU overhead by ~15% in static scenes.
```
